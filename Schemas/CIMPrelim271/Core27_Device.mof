// Description: The Core Model defines basic management concepts. 
//              This file defines the concepts for LogicalDevices (the
//              logical abstractions and management of installed 
//              hardware).
//
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined 
//              by other working groups, are omitted.
// ==================================================================
// Change Log for v2.7
// CR624 - Fixed several of the DMI mapping strings that were missing 
//         the attribute number in LogicalDevice
// CR720 - Deprecate the use of LogicalDevice.PowerManagementSupported,
//         LogicalDevice.PowerManagementCapabilities, & LogicalDevice.
//         SetPowerState()
// CR761 - Add the Composition Qualifer to SystemDevice
// CR763 - Change subclassing of LogicalDevice from LogicalElement to
//         EnabledLogicalElement
//       - Deprecate LogicalDevice.StatusInfo
//       - Update description of LogicalDevice.EnableDevice() to 
//         explain position relative to LogicalDevice.RequestedStatus
//       - Update description of LogicalDevice.OnlineDevice() and 
//         QuiesceDevice to make reference to EnabledStatus
