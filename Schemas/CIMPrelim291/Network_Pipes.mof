// Description: The Network Model extends the management concepts to
//              represent protocol interfaces and network/protocol
//              services.  This file models network pipes, based on
//              the ITU M.3100 definitions.
// 
//              The object classes below are listed in an order that
//              avoids forward references. Required objects, defined
//              by other working groups, are omitted.
// ==================================================================
// Change Log for v2.9 preliminary
// CR1347 - add iSCSI classes
// CR1355 - Add properties to iscsi session
// CR1465 - Remove extra space in MappingStrings
//           { "MIB.IETF|IPS-AUTH-MIB.ipsAuthCredAuthMethod "}
// 
// Change Log for v2.7
// CR696 - Add M.3100 concepts of Pipe; Define the associations,
//         HostedPipe, EndpointOfPipe, and PipeComposition
// CR850 - Change CIM_Pipe to CIM_NetworkPipe; Propagate this change
//         through the model; Make similar name changes throughout
//         the other classes
// CR961 - Changes to Enabled and RequestedState in NetworkPipe,
//         inherited from EnabledLogicalElement
// CR982 - Removal of Experimental for preliminary to final
// CR994 - Update of the InstanceID property Description
// Change Log for v2.8
// CR1128 - Change subclassing from CIM_Dependency to
//          CIM_HostedDependency for identified classes. This is
//          needed as a result of the introduction of HostedDependency
