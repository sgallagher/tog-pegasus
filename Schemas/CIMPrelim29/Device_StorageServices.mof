   [Version ( "2.8.1000" ), Description (
       "StorageSetting is roughly equivalent to a Service Level "
       "Agreement (SLA) It defines the characteristics, qualities of "
       "service and goals when used in a CreateOrModifyElement "
       "FromStoragePool or CreateOrModifyStoragePool method in the "
       "StorageConfigurationService. It specifies a series of "
       "properties with Maximum and Minimum values that define the "
       "(inclusive) bounds that the object should maintain. Note that "
       "the setting is associated to a StorageVolume or LogicalDisk, "
       "using ElementSetting. \n"
       "The use of these properties differs depending on whether the "
       "StorageSetting instance is being used as a goal for a "
       "configuration operation or being used as a Service Level "
       "Agreement for a created Volume. In addition the properties "
       "fall into two categories: The QOS "
       "properties(PackageRedundancy, Data Redundancy, & "
       "NoSinglePointOfFailure) and the Detailed RAID "
       "properties(ExtentStripeLength, ParityLayout, and "
       "UserDataStripeDepth). In a Setting used as a goal, the QOS "
       "properties are required as a set; The Detailed RAID "
       "properties(if supported as indicated by the scoping "
       "StorageCapabilities instance) may be used optionally in any "
       "combination. The implementation MUST supply it's own best "
       "practice in the case where one or more supported RAID "
       "properties are not supplied. In this situation the use of "
       "StorageSettingWithHints can be useful to provide direction to "
       "the implementation. \n"
       "In a Setting used as a service agreement for a Volume, the QOS "
       "properties reflect the Service Level Agreement, with goal, "
       "min, & max. The actual current service level is exposed by "
       "corresponding values in StorageExtent. \n"
       "The Detailed RAID properties, by contrast, reflect specific "
       "values that reflect the RAID construction of the Volume. Only "
       "the primary values are meaningful; Min and Max are set to "
       "match. \n"
       "Certain StorageSetting instances may be classed as \"Fixed\", "
       "by using the \"ChangeableType\" property, indicating the "
       "setting is preset. Such settings are used when the possible "
       "setting variations are low enough to be instantiated in their "
       "entirety. The StorageCapabilities \"CreateSetting\" method MAY "
       "NOT be used to return settings that are not changeable. \n"
       "Other StorageSetting instances are created using the "
       "\"CreateSetting\" method. If the capabilities specifies "
       "ranges, then the setting can be used by a client to narrow the "
       "range to particular values within the range. In other words, "
       "the capabilities MAY be broad, but the related setting MUST be "
       "as capable or less capable, that is more narrowly defined, "
       "before it is used to create or modify resources. \n"
       "These created StorageSetting instances MUST have their "
       "\"ChangeableType\" property = 1, \"Changeable - Transient\". \n"
       "GeneratedSettings MAY not remain after the restart or reset of "
       "the implementation. They may be deleted by implementation at "
       "any time. A reasonable minimal time to retain the generated "
       "transient settings is five minutes, although there is no "
