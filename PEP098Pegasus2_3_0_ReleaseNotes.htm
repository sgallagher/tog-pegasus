<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="#000000">Functionality of This Release</font></h2>
<p>The overall level of functionality in the Pegasus environment effective with 
this release is as follows:</p>
<p><b>CIM Server</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>CIM Operations over HTTP</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class Operations (getClass, deleteClass, modifyClass, enumerateClass, 
    enuerateClassNames) - 
    Operational</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualifier Operations - Operational</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instance Operations (getInstance, deleteInstance, modifyInstance, enumerateInstance, 
    enumerateInstanceNames, getProperty, setProperty) 
    - Operational</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Association Operations (references, referencenames, 
    associators, associatornames - Operational </li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methods- Operational</li>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Query operation (Not Operational)</li>
  </ol>
<p><b>Indications</b> </p>
<p>Process indications are operational in the Server.&nbsp; This includes 
support for subscriptions, filters, and indication handlers, the provider API 
for indications and the CIMXML indication handler. The Pegasus 
sever can be used as an Indication client.&nbsp; The Client indication&nbsp; API support is complete but the interfaces are marked experimental for version 2.3 
because this is the first version of Pegasus in which these APIs were available.  </p>
<p><b>Query Language</b></p>
<p>The query language today is based on WQL and is implemented and used for 
filters.&nbsp; However, the executeQuery operation has not been implemented 
pending the availability of a standard DMTF Query language.</p>
<p><b>Class Repository</b></p>
<p>XML based file/directory Class repository.</p>
<p><b>Instance Repository</b></p>
<p>XML based file/directory Instance repository.&nbsp; 
The instance repository is used as the default repository unless a flag is set 
disabling this repository for client operations.</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Basic Security (Note that Digest based security is not implemented)</li>
    <li>SSL support - SSL is implemented in Pegasus using the OpenSSL libraries. 
    Pegasus does not provide the OpenSSL libraries but SSL can be used on any 
    platform supported by OpenSSL.</li>
  </ol>
<p><b>Platform Management Functions</b></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Configuration through the defined configuration parameters.</li>
    <li>Daemon operation on all supported platforms</li>
    <li>User management utilities</li>
    <li>Provider management. The CIM Server provides dynamic registration of 
    providers and automatic load and unload functionality.</li>
  </ol>
<p><b>SLP Discovery</b></p>
<p>SLP support is enabled in the platform but is conditionally compiled with the 
default to not compile it today pending further testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>&nbsp;Providers</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;There are a number of standard providers available in Pegasus release. This 
includes providers in the following categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Internal Providers</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>__Namespace provider - Serves the __Namespace class to allow manipulation of 
namespaces.</li>
  <li>Subscription Classes Providers - These provide subscription, filter, and 
  indication handler processing.</li>
  <li>Provider registration Providers - This provide registration of providers 
  using the PG_Provider classes.</li>
  <li>ConfigProvider - Manages Pegasus configuraton information.</li>
  <li>UserAuthProvider - Manages password, etc.</li>
  <li>ShutdownProvider - Provides support for Pegasus shutdown.</li>
  <li>Interop Provider - Supports many of the DMTF Interop Schema Classes 
  including CIM_Namespace, CIM_ObjectManager, etc. (Note that this provider is 
  part of the SLP work package so is not compiled as part of the default 
  compile)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Generic Providers</b></p>
<p>Generic OperatingSystem provider. See the directory src/Providers/generic.</p>
<p><b>Test/Sample Providers</b></p>
<p>See the directories src/Providers/TestProviders and src/Sample 
for more information about test and sample providers.</p>
<p><b>Managed System Providers</b></p>
<p>ComputerSystem, DNSAdmin, DNSService, Operating System, Process, Processor. 
For more information on these providers see the documentation for each provider 
in the directory src/Providers/ManagedSystem</p>
<p><b>CIMOM Statistics Providers</b></p>
<p>IBMStatisticalData - This is an early version of the work 
that became CIM_StatisticalData. It is similar to CIM_StatisticalData and 
provides the same data but the structure of the Classes is slightly different. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Linux Specific Providers</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a number of providers in this category including DiskDrive, 
CDROMDrive, Interrupt, IOPOrt, IPROute, NetworkAdapter, Operating System, PCI 
Controller, Processor, ProviderData, ProviderSupport, SoftwareElement.&nbsp; For 
more information about these providers see the documentation in the directory 
src/Providers/linux</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>CIM_Schema</b></p>
<p>The default CIM_Schema loaded with the Pegasus 2.2 release is the DMTF CIM 
2.7 Final release.&nbsp; In addition, Pegasus includes a number of local classes 
defined for Pegasus.&nbsp; These are visible in the Schemas directory.</p>
<p><b>Pegasus MOF Compiler</b></p>
<p>Pegasus implements a MOF compiler that can operate either at the client 
interface (cimmof) or directly interfacing with a CIM repository (cimmofl).</p>
<p>The direct interface compiler is used primarily to provide an initial 
class/instance repository. Note that use of cimmofl to manipulate instances in the repository bypasses 
any provider that is registered to serve the instances and simply installs the 
instances in the instance repository; this may result in corruption if providers 
are using the repository.&nbsp; Use of cimmofl to manipulate instances served by 
a registered providers is therefore discouraged. Use of cimmof rather that 
cimmofl is encouraged.</p>
<p><b>Client Tools</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Pegasus CIM Server Adminstration</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>cimuser - Manage Pegasus CIM server Users</li>
  <li>cimconfig - Manage the Pegasus CIM Server configuration parameters</li>
  <li>cimauth - Manage the CIM Server authorization characteristics. Today this 
  is authorizing users to namespaces.</li>
  <li>cimprovider - Manage information about the providers.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Information client tools</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; These tools provide information on the objects managed by 
the server.</p>
<ol>
  <li>tomof - output Classes and/or instance information in MOF or XML format.</li>
  <li>dnsinfo - </li>
  <li>ipinfo - Generates a set of standard information from the Network Schema.&nbsp; 
  Information generated varies by system because of the level of provider 
  support.</li>
  <li>osinfo - Generate a set of standard information on the Operating System 
  from CIM Classes. Note that the information generated is dependent on the 
  information available from providers and differes from system to system</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Test support Tools</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Pegasus Unit tests (available through the &quot;tests&quot; option on the Pegasus 
  make files&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The Pegasus Test Suite (see the tests directory and the Pegasus/TestBuildMakeFile)</li>
  <li>TestClient - Basic client for overall platform operation testing. </li>
  <li>CGICLient - This client has not been completely update to version 2.2.</li>
  <li>wbemexec - Test tool that sends/receives XML from XML input.</li>
  <li>CLI - Command line interface for Client commands.</li>
  <li>Benchmark Test - Introduced with Pegasus 2.3, a benchmark test environment 
  is not provided which includes both a client and provider component. See src/clients/benchmarkTest 
  for more information.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Pegasus Interface APIs</b></p>
<p>Details of the Pegasus public interfaces for release 2.3 is listed in PEP 96 
available from the web site(www.openpegasus.org). This document is the 
authorative source for the list of publicly supported Pegasus APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Client and Provider API 
were originally frozen at the&nbsp; Pegasus version 2.1 release. The interfaces 
in the release of Pegasus 2.1 are forward compatible to release 2.3 (clients and 
providers compiled to the Pegasus 2.1 or 2.2 interfaces should be compatible 
with Pegasus 2.3 without compilation)&nbsp; but there 
have been extensions and new interfaces added for release 2.3 &nbsp; The public interfaces includes the following major 
functions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Client APIs</li>
  <li>Provider APIs</li>
  <li>CIM Objects</li>
  <li>CIM Listener (experimental for Pegasus 2.3). These are compiled only if 
  the PEGASUS_USE_EXPERIMENTAL_INTERFACES flag is set.</li>
  <li>SLP Client (experimental for Pegasus 2.3). These are compiled only if the 
  PEGASUS_USE_EXPERIMENTAL_INTERFACES flag is set.</li>
</ol>
<p>The functions are documented in their respective header files and HTML 
documentation based on the information in the header files extracted with the 
doc++ tool will be available on the OpenPegasus web site.</p>
<p><b>WMI Mapper</b></p>
<p>A version of of the Pegasus platform that specifically communicates with 
Microsoft WMI implementations and interfaces with WMI object is provided as a 
separately compilable code set in the CVS.</p>
<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Each Pegasus release lists as supported platforms those hardware/software 
platforms that have recognized ports for the Pegasus code base including a 
maintainer for the platform that will be willing to regularly assure that the 
port is maintained as the Pegasus code base is changed.&nbsp; Pegasus may be 
operable on other platforms (ex. Windows 98) but without a group to provide the 
role of test and maintenance, the Pegasus project cannot assure operation. The 
supported platforms for current release are:</p>

<h2>Conformance with DMTF Specifications</h2>
<p>Pegasus tries to conform to the CIM specifications.&nbsp; It is a 
major goal of the OpenPegasus project to both drive and utilize the 
DMTF CIM/WBEM specifications.&nbsp; However, today there are a number of differences.&nbsp; As 
of Pegasus 2.3, some of the differences include the following:</p>
<p>1. Provider Registration - Pegasus supports registration through a set of 
Provider registration classes&nbsp; similar to the CIM Classes defined as 
experimental in the CIM 2.8 preliminary Schema release and does not support the Provider Qualifier. 
Note that there are  differences that must still be worked out 
between the Pegasus PG provider registration classes and the CIM classes as part of the 
move to release of the CIM classes.</p>
<p>2. Indications -Pegasus supports process indications but does not 
include any specific support for lifecycle indications.</p>
<p>3. Interop Schema - Today Pegasus provides alternatives to some of the classes in the Interop 
Schema including CIM_StatisticalData.</p>
<p>4. execQuery operaiton - Today Pegasus does not support the execQuery pending the availability of a 
standard for the query language.</p>
<p>5. Pegasus differs from some other implementations in the delivery of 
instance and class qualifiers on some operations.</p>
<p>6. Pegasus has not implemented the alias functions defined in the CIM 
specification in the MOF compiler.</p>
<h2>Changes in this Release</h2>
<p>The development and release of each version of Pegasus is defined and 
controlled through Pegasus PEP documents.&nbsp; PEP 57 is the controlling 
document this release and lists the original set of changes proposed and the status of 
each of those changes. Note that not all of the originally defined functionality 
was completed for this release.</p>
<p>In general, the changes implemented for this release were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introduction of platform globalization. </li>
  <li>Introduction of a listener API</li>
  <li>Introduction of SLP (still experimental and by default not compiled in the 
  2.3.0 release)</li>
  <li>Introduction of a new pluggable Provider Manager (still experimental and by default 
  not compiled in the 2.3.0 release)</li>
  <li>Introduction of extensive changes to the HTTP monitor (still experimental and 
  not compiled in the 2.3.0 release)</li>
  <li>Incorporation of a Java Client based on the SNIA code base.</li>
  <li>Additional Indication Handlers (SNMP)</li>
  <li>Improvements to indication handling.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that there were a number of objectives that were not completely achieved 
including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>SLP integration - This code is in place but is compiled only with a 
  conditional compile flag. This code can be enabled by setting the environment 
  variables PEGASUS_SLP_ENABLE and PEGASUS_SLP_CLASSES and recompiling Pegasus.</li>
  <li>Pluggable provider manager - This was a major objective but because the 
  code changes were extensive and released very late in the developement cycle 
  of 2.3, both the old and the new provider managers are maintained in the 
  release AND the old provider manager is defined as the default compile.&nbsp; 
  To compile and run with the new pluggable provider manager functions the user 
  must set a compile flag (ENABLE_PROVIDER_MANAGER2).&nbsp; NOTE: It is the intention of the Pegasus project to move to 
  the new provider manager as soon as possible.</li>
  <li>HTTP Monitor enhancements - As with the Pluggable Provider Manager, it was 
  the intention to incorporate a number of enhancements to the HTTP monitor.&nbsp; 
  Again because the time in the development phase when they were submitted, the 
  project team elected to release 2.3 with the existing monitor as the default 
  compile but with the code for both monitors. It is the intention to move to 
  the new monitor as soon as possible and users are free to work with either 
  implementation.&nbsp; To compile and run with the new monitor use the flag 
  PEGASUS_MONITOR2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The set of PEPs defined for this release is summarized below along with the 
final implementation status because not all of the PEPs originally defined for 
this version were implemented:</p>
